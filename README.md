# Stupid-Simple

This repository will contain simple things (which may often sound stupid) that I'll keep building as and when I come across them.

Why? Because beauty lies in the simple things, and because I can program ;-)

Right now the projects under this are:
 - [Owl] (https://github.com/Sheikh-Aman/Stupid-Simple/tree/master/Owl) - a simple script which finds out which are the most viewed video of a YouTube channel
